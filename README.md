## Developing


* Connect this repository as a subtree/submodule.
* Compile the structures for the required programming language. By default, protobuf definitions are generated using the Go language. [Learn more about Go Generated Code](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/go-generated)
* Request to one of the PaySuper services using the compiled structures.
